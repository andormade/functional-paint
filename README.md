# functional-paint

This is a JavaScript library for manipulating image buffers with pure functions. It's not the most efficient way of doing this, and you probably won't be able to use this library in a performance-critical project. It's just for practicing image processing algorithms and functional programming.  

This code is released under the MIT license, feel free to do whatever you want with it.
